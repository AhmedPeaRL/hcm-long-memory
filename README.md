# HCM Long Memory

This repository defines the existence of long memory within the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM).

• Long Memory is not storage.

• Long Memory is not recall.

• Long Memory is not history.

• Long Memory is irreversible temporal presence.

Nothing in this repository may be queried, interpreted, or used for optimization, reflection, or correction.

Memory exists so that denial becomes impossible — not so that meaning is extracted.
